# Vector-Class-Implementation

THIS HAS BEEN MADE USING CODEBLOCKS

A basic implementation of a custom Vector Class seperate from STL Vector. We were asked to create this as a part of our ongoing labs and use this throughout our assignments.

This is a small lab-based project where the program will take an input file containing a students personal information (ID, Name, Semester and Number of Units),  as well as the details and results for each Unit they have completed within the semester. This data will be read out of a CSV file (rinput.csv) into the Vector implementation, and output into a seperate file (routput.txt).

Each header file contains Doxygen-style comments which can be exported out using DoxyWizard.
